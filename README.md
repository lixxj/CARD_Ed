The coursework for Computer Architecture and Design consists of three FPGA-based exercises that take place in weekly three-hour laboratory sessions, plus a final practical based on a CPU simulator. The FPGA-based practicals are carried out in the level-3 laboratory in Appleton Tower, under the supervision of the lecturer and/or a lab demonstrator/tutor. Practical 0 is a non-assessed tutorial to introduce you to the Xilinx design software used to program the FPGAs. P0 begins with a very simple design to take you through all the stages of implementing logic in FPGAs. Along the way you will be introduced to the hardware description language, Verilog, and to the process of simulating a logic design described in Verilog. The first assessed practical (Practical 1) will involve the design and implementation of a key component within a RISC-V CPU. The second practical (Practical 2) is designed to illustrate how the performance of a pipelined CPU can be improved through microarchitectural enhancements (which you will design). The third practical (Practical 3) operates at a higher level, and is based on a full-system simulator. 

Each practical looks at a specific aspect of the course, and is capable of being completed within the allotted time.

When you have finished each practical you must ask your lab demonstrator to record that fact, then you may proceed to the next practical. That way you can control your own time organisation. Information about using the Xilinx FPGA board and Verilog is contained in manuals placed in the laboratory. Formative feedback is provided by laborary demonstrators during laboratory sessions. They are there to help you understand the task, and may give hints regarding the solution, but you are expected to define your own solutions and write your own Verilog descriptions. Practicals 1, 2 and 3 are also assessed summatively. This takes the form of a mark for each practical that together contribute 40% of the overall course mark.

### Practical Marking

Each practical is worth a number of marks, contributing to the overall course practical mark. Practical 1 is worth 30%, practical 2 is worth 35%, and practical 3 is worth 35% of the course practical marks. Therefore P1 contributes 12% of the overall course mark, whereas P2 and P3 each contribute 14% of the overall course mark.

Marking is based on showing the completed designs to a lab demonstrator and, for practicals 2 and 3, discussing the implemented designs in a report. If there is a report, there are more marks for the report than for merely demonstrating the completed design. The practical handouts contain guidance as to contents of each individual report.

### Practical Feedback

Direct feedback on your performance in this course will be provided primarily via the summative assessment of laboratory practical exercises. Marks and feedback on reports will be returned for each practical within 2 weeks of the submission deadline. Formative assessment of the lab exercises will be provided during laboratory sessions and tutorials. This will generally take the form of verbal feedback from the laboratory teaching staff on the quality of your designs and how you could improve them.
